## Features

Lucy is equipped with a variety of commands and listeners to enhance your server experience:

### Commands

Commands are special instructions that users can give the bot by typing a specific word or phrase, typically preceded by a prefix (in this case, an exclamation point `!`). Lucy supports both public and private commands:

- **Public Commands:** These can be used by all server members.
- **Private Commands:** These commands are restricted and only accessible to authorized users.

### Listeners

Listeners are features that enable Lucy to respond automatically to certain events or messages in the server, enhancing interactivity and automating responses.

### Notable Commands

- **`!draw` Command:** This command is particularly powerful, as it compares molecular structures, providing insightful comparisons and analyses.
- **`!info` Command:** Acts as a portal to concise and relevant answers, tailored to the user's query.

- **Operating System:** Arch Linux
